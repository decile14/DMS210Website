    <h3>About the Bookwheel At the University of Rochester</h3>

    <p> In 2018 individuals from the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology merged forced and built and designed the only two functioning bookwheels currently. Thes individuals included Gregory Heyworth who is an English professor at the U of R, Steven Galbraith, RIT curator of RIT's Cary Graphic Arts Collection, Reese Saen, Design Lead, Matt Nygren, Communication Lead, and Maher Abdelkawi, Facilitator/Purchaser, and Ian Kurtz. Since Ramelli never built the bookwheel, some engineering students from RIT decided to create it for their senior project. 


    <p>The two bookwheels currently reside in RIT's Cary Archive and University of Rochester's Robbin's Library. While you're there, take a spin! </p>
