    <h3>History of the Bookwheel</h3>

  	<p>The traditional bookwheel was invented in 1588 by Agostino Ramelli who was an Italian military engineer. The <b>use</b> of the bookwheel is to function as a rotating bookcase. It moves like a yoyo or ferris wheel would. It also is useful for people with mobile disabilities because it helps them access books without getting up. It is known for being the solution to control a large collection of books. This tool inspired technologies such as hypertext and e-readers specifically in their shared traits of accessing and storing a lot of information. 


  	<p>Essentially the machine's taask is to hold up many heavy books at one time. According to <b>Professor Gregory Heyworth</b>, the wheel aided the assembly of encyclepedias.</p>

    <h3>About the Bookwheel At the University of Rochester</h3>

    <p> In 2018 individuals from the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology merged forced and built and designed the only two functioning bookwheels currently. Thes individuals included Gregory Heyworth who is an English professor at the U of R, Steven Galbraith, RIT curator of RIT's Cary Graphic Arts Collection, Reese Saen, Design Lead, Matt Nygren, Communication Lead, and Maher Abdelkawi, Facilitator/Purchaser, and Ian Kurtz. Since Ramelli never built the bookwheel, some engineering students from RIT decided to create it for their senior project. 


    <p>The two bookwheels currently reside in RIT's Cary Archive and University of Rochester's Robbin's Library. While you're there, take a spin! </p>
